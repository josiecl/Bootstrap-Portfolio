                <p>This was my first site built with a team. I was a front-end developer along with Omaur Bliss, while Betiel Habtemariam and Jennifer Nelson worked on back-end development. This site allows users to search a movie, which will return a description of said movie. The user can then select this movie, which will return books either about or related to said movie. The user can then store books they wish to save in their library. This site makes use of several APIs, local storage, and session storage. Link to site <a href="https://omaurbliss.github.io/Seinfeld.oi/">here</a>, and links to <a href="https://github.com/OmaurBliss">Omaur's</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jnel-221">Jennifer's</a>, <a href="https://github.com/betielbetu">Betiel's</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/josiecl">my</a> Github pages here.</p>

                <p>Dear Diary was my second site that I built with a team. I was a back-end developer on this app, along with Bao Xiong and Melissa Hoang. Melissa Hoang also worked on front-end with Betiel Habtemariam and Asli Farah. Its purpose was to allow users to record their thoughts and ideas from a day in a secure site that they can access from any device. It makes use of express-server, session-storage, sequelize, and many other technologies.

                <p>This website is from an assignment where I was given an existing site and had to modify it to make it work. I used Javascript to successfully accomplish this task. It gave me a better understanding of Javascript as a whole, as I made use of several new concepts such as 'if' statements and pulling from arrays. With this new knowledge, I was able to make a functioning random password generator. Link to website <a href="https://josiecl.github.io/03-Javascript-Assignment/">here</a>.</p>

                <p>This website was built from scratch. It's a quiz about dog trivia, with a functioning timer and a responsive layout. The user can also submit their initials with their time at the end of the quiz, which will then be saved to local storage. This site also made use of dynamically generating new screens from arrays upon button press. Link to site <a href="https://josiecl.github.io/04-Coding-Quiz/">here</a>.</p>
