# Title
Bootstrap Portfolio

# Why It Was Made
I needed to make a site that gave information about me, showed some images that represented me, and also had a contact form (even if that doesn't work yet). It also needed to use Bootstrap and be responsive. I followed these guidelines, and have made a site that is responsive, complete with working links, information, images, and a nice layout. It works as it should and I'm very proud of the end result.

# Information
I made this Portfolio using mostly Bootstrap elements, as I understood from the assignment. It was very interesting to get a better feel on how bootstrap works, and I found it was highly advantageous to use in this assignment. I'm very glad to have had the opportunity to work with it and better understand it. 

# Struggles
I had some difficulties with the formatting of the pages. I couldn't ever get them to look exactly like the example images, but I did my best to have it look as close as possible. I found that using the columns to space things out was very useful in this instance, and I'm pretty pleased with the outcome. I'll be doing more coding like this in the near future to get more accustomed to using bootstrap efficiently.

# Outcome
While it isn't perfect, I think it looks pretty decent. I'm very happy with it being interactive, and I feel I put a good amount of work into it. I wasn't quite sure what images to add for the gallery, however, so I just put in ones of my pets and my art. I like how this portfolio turned out nonetheless.
