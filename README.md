# Title
Bootstrap Portfolio

# Why it was made
I needed to make a site that gave information about me, showed some images that represented me, and also had a contact form (even if that doesn't work yet). It also needed to use Bootstrap and be responsive. I followed these guidelines, and have made a site that is responsive, complete with working links, information, images, and a nice layout. It works as it should and I'm very proud of the end result.

# Information
I made this Portfolio using mostly Bootstrap elements, as I understood from the assignment. It was very interesting to get a better feel on how bootstrap works, and I found it was highly advantageous to use in this assignment. I'm very glad to have had the opportunity to work with it and better understand it. Since first making the site, I've added a great deal of CSS, and formatted the site to look nicer. It's responsive and utilizes CSS well. 

# Struggles
I had some difficulties with the formatting of the pages at first, but with the redesign I've fixed many of these issues. I did have issues with getting some of my h3 tags to align in the center, but I worked around this. I didn't have too many issues this time around, actually. In any case, I think this site turned out much better than it initially had.

# Outcome
With the updates, I feel it has a very nice look to it. I like its design much more now. I've also replaced the previous images with ones related to coding, since I've been able to make websites since this was first made. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this portfolio. It looks much better than I could have ever imagined, and I've certainly come a long way since first making it.
